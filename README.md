### Introduction
In this report, we will be investigating the CO2 emission by vehicles from 2000 to 2014. The dataset we used is called “Fuel consumption ratings” and was made available to the public by the Government  of Canada on March 31, 2017. We chose this dataset because it contains very interesting findings that we can work with and do analysis on to further understand how much CO2 is being emitted by vehicles depending on the different features they have. Earlier, we selected a dataset that did not have a time attribute and therefore, it was challenging to perform predictive analysis. Fortunately, we found a similar dataset that does have a time attribute. Now we were able to predict the CO2 emission for the next few years.

### Discussion (need to put this into paragraph form)

- Sports/luxury car manufacturers emitted most CO2
- Heatmap - number of cylinders and fuel consumption have a strong positive correlation
- Engine size and fuel consumption have a moderate positive correlation
- Fuel consumption and CO2 have a strong positive correlation
Diesel is the most efficient fuel type
Ethanol and Natural Gas are the least efficient fuel types
Since ethanol is the least efficient fuel type per litre, it emits more CO2. Ethanol uses more fuel as compared to other fuel types to generate the same amount of energy and therefore, emits more CO2.
Regular gasoline was used most by vehicles between 2000 and 2014
Natural gas was the least used fuel type between 2000 and 2014
Larger vehicles emit more CO2
Fuel consumption and CO2 emission are directly related; more fuel consumed, more CO2 emitted
