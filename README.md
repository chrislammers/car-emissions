### Introduction

### Discussion (need to put this into paragraph form)

While initially exploring the data, we found that vehicles from sports/luxury car manufacturers such as Bugatti, Ferrari, and Bentley emitted most CO2. Vehicles from brands like Smart, Fiat, and Mini generally produce less CO2.
All of the columns in this dataset were closely related to each other. The number of cylinders, fuel consumption, and CO2 emission of each vehicle have a strong positive correlation. Engine size and fuel consumption have a moderate positive correlation. (Figure 1)
(Figure 2)
(Figure 3)
- Diesel is the most efficient fuel type
- Ethanol and Natural Gas are the least efficient fuel types (Figure 4)
Looking at fuel types compared to their average CO2 emissions, the graph is similar to Figure 4. The one exception is ethanol, which is the least efficient fuel type per litre, but on average it emits less CO2 than natural gas does. (Figure 5)
- Regular gasoline was used most by vehicles between 2000 and 2014
- Natural gas was the least used fuel type between 2000 and 2014
- Larger vehicles emit more CO2
- Fuel consumption and CO2 emission are directly related; more fuel consumed, more CO2 emitted
- Strong positive correlation between engine size and CO2 emission. The larger the engine size, the more CO2 produced
