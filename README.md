# Introduction
In this report, we will be investigating the CO2 emission by vehicles from 2000 to 2014. The dataset we used is called “Fuel consumption ratings” and was made available to the public by the Government  of Canada on March 31, 2017. We chose this dataset because it contains very interesting findings that we can work with and do analysis on to further understand how much CO2 is being emitted by vehicles depending on the different features they have. Earlier, we selected a dataset that did not have a time attribute and therefore, it was challenging to perform predictive analysis. Fortunately, we found a similar dataset that does have a time attribute. Now we were able to predict the CO2 emission for the next few years.
